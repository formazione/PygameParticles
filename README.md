# PygameParticles
Files for a tutorial on particles in pygame (link: https://youtu.be/yfcsB3SGsKY)

Ok, this is a script to make particles effects with python using the module pygame. It makes a lot of little circles or images to simulate smog, fog fire, fireworks and other stuffs.
This one, in  particular, shows a cat with a lot of stars. The stars are the particles. The code is not mine, I just changed it a little bit.
